The easy way is to first install the [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation) plugin.
Once it's installed, press Ctrl-Shift-P (or Cmd-Shift-P), type `install`, and select "Package Control: Install Packages".
Then type "doge", and choose to install the SendText plugin.
