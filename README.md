# doge - such sublime plugin

Doge is a sublime plugin that shows you a picture of doge if your cursor is currently on the word "doge" (See screenshot). This plugin is essential for Doge fans everywhere and everyone who would consider themselves to be "wow." Much doge, so sublime, wow.

## Installation

I attempted to put this plugin on Package Control however they deemed it as "essentially useless" and "don't think adding it to the PC channel will be of use for anyone" [(here)](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel/pull/4259). Frankly I was pretty offended because it was my first plugin (I wasn't aware of this user-checked pull request) and I didn't realize Package Control was so "selective" for a searched-based package manager but what are you going to do! Some people just don't see the joy that this plugin could bring! I probably won't work on anymore Sublime Plugins anymore unless I stumble upon an idea that's "usefull" in the eyes of Package Control. If you wanted to make a fun sublime plugin, don't bother going to Package Control... but I hope those of you who like Doge, will appreciate this and perhaps say something.

The ONLY way is to clone this git repository into your `Sublime Text 3/Packages` directory. This will be in different places depending on the OS:

* Windows: `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages`
* OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages`
* Linux: `~/.config/sublime-text-3`

```
git clone https://github.com/tylerl0706/doge.git
```
## Using doge

If for any reason you need to turn doge off for a little bit, you can simply press this to toggle doge on and off:
* (Windows/Linux): ctrl+shift+!
* (Mac): cmd+shift+!


Enjoy!
